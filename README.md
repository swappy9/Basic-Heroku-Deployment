# Basic-Heroku-Deployment

The repository is created to showcase the steps involved in the basic deployment of machine learning models using the Heroku and flask.

## Overall flow

1. Build the Machine Learning model
2. Create a WebApp using Flask
3. Create a repo in Github [Use to deploy with Herolu]
4. Create an app in free Heroku account
5. Deploy the model in heroku app

## Building ML Model to deploy

I have used the Kaggle Houe Price prediction dataset to create a very simple machine learning linear regression model to work.
Kaggle Link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview

train.csv: Training dataset with 81 columns
test.csv: Test dataset with 80 columns (Not used in the implementation)
Model.py: Script building and saving the linear model in pickle file

## Creating WebApp

I have used
